|| Kongregate API - Monkey version
||
|| Created & maintained by Brad Davies (DPbrad)
||

|| This module allows games created in Monkey to make use of the Kongregate API when building a game to the Flash target (All other targets are not supported by Kongregate).
|| 
|| Info...
||
|||| - The entire module was created and tested by Brad Davies (DPbrad), and you use it at your own risk. That includes if it tries to maim or kill you, I am not responsible!
|||| - It is still a work-in-progress, I will be refining it and improving things over time.
